  ## 01. Hero Section

  hero:

    headline: Elevate public services.

    text: You want to make the recovery from the pandemic fast, fair, and effective. Open Contracting Lift is our impact accelerator program to help teams of bold procurement reformers around the world to go further with their ideas and deliver change. <strong>How will you use open contracting to support an inclusive and effective recovery?</strong>

  ## 02. Intro Section

  intro:

    leftCol:

      text: Open Contracting Lift is our program to help teams of bold procurement reformers around the globe propel their project ideas forward and deliver systemic change in a world still struggling with the fiscal, social, and personal challenges of COVID-19.

    rightCol:

      text: >
        <p>Your goal could be to use open contracting to support an inclusive and effective recovery by:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Expanding economic opportunity</strong>: boosting opportunities for women-, minority-owned or local businesses to participate in public procurement, or building the capacity of small, locally-owned businesses to compete and win government contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving public services and infrastructure:</strong> stocking hospitals fairly with the best medicines and protective equipment, equipping public schools with the supplies and infrastructure they need to serve students and their families, higher quality public housing, or expanding access to affordable and green public transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Increasing government effectiveness and accountability:</strong> improving integrity through monitoring and advocacy, increasing competition and reducing sole sourcing, using data and insight for decision-making, or working more efficiently to reduce the cost of issuing public contracts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recognize that you may be struggling with less capacity or resources because of the pandemic. We are here to help.</p>
        <p>Over 18 months, you will receive extensive, tailored support from leading experts and peers to deliver better goods, works, and services, and expand economic opportunity for everyone through new or better contracting strategies. We’ll help you transform your great idea into a strong plan for action, build buy-in, and strengthen your capacity during implementation. Teams will be eligible for up to $30,000 worth of direct support depending on team needs and progress, as well as 200 hours of technical assistance and support from OCP. </p>

        “Lift helped cut the learning curve. Of course we were starting to learn, but this program helped us learn faster. Plus, the political support and the technical assistance really helped us reach our milestones in terms of opening up the data.”

    text: >
      <p>We want to hear your new ideas for using open contracting to support an inclusive and effective recovery. We know that your time is more valuable than ever - that is why we made the initial application short. Completing just ten questions could get you 200 hours of support! <p>For inspiration, check out how <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/implement/lift/">teams around the world have used Lift </a> to help their reform projects go further, faster.</p>

  ## 03. Why Apply Section

  whyApply:

    heading: Why apply?

    text: You want to contribute to a better and more inclusive recovery that serves the needs of marginalized or underrepresented communities. You recognize that shrinking government budgets mean that we must make the most out of every dollar. You see procurement as a lever to deliver better results.

    quote1:
      text: >
        “If you want to create more or better impact, this program is perfect.”
      attribution:

    left:
      heading: Propel your reform ambitions.
      text: Get better results from your reform project. Create effective public contracting strategies that will help you achieve your ambitious goals.

    center:
      heading: Learn globally, change locally.
      text: With 200 hours of technical support, you will get bespoke guidance on how to use public contracting to deliver better results. Learn about what works and which mistakes to avoid when building buy-in, using open data and implementing results-driven contracting strategies with vendors and stakeholders.

    right:
      heading: Join a community of reformers.
      text: Connect with experienced peers who have led successful reforms and overcome similar challenges. Co-work with experts who can help you adapt proven solutions to your context. All applicants will be invited to join an online community to share progress and lessons with fellow practitioners.

    quote2:
      text: >
        “I would describe Lift as a great partnership, having someone there to back up your crazy idea. Someone who believes in your change, keeps you on track, and holds you accountable (in a good way!) to your own hypothesis and ideas.”

  ## 04. Who Can Apply Section

  whoApply:

    heading: Who can apply?

    text: You can be a government agency, civil society, media, academic or technology organization, or a social entrepreneur. You can also apply as a coalition of actors. Our strongest teams so far have brought together multiple actors across government agencies and across government and civil society.

    left1:
      heading: Plans for impact from contracting.
      text: Lift is open to teams working to improve the quality of public goods, works or services. You wish to serve your citizens better, engage more diverse vendors or help governments save time and money. You have a clear goal in mind and a problem that you are trying to solve—at the national, regional, city, or municipality level.

    right1:
      heading: Projects with momentum, at all levels of maturity.
      text: Teams can be working on projects at different stages of development. You could be embarking on a new initiative or working to refine and scale a piloted solution. Projects will need to show demonstrated support from senior leadership to qualify.

    left2:
      heading: Teams who can drive change.
      text: >
        Lift is all about having the capacity to make your big idea a reality. Your team should include at least two key roles: someone who can build political support and someone who can navigate the procurement system. If your project requires expertise in a highly technical area, such as data or technology, you should also have a technical expert on your team. Lift is open to teams from any sector and most countries.

    right2:
      heading: Teams who bring together allies in reform.
      text: >
        We require that Lift reform teams be cross-agency or cross-organizational. This is because we have seen that the strongest reform teams typically work together across sectors and across organizations.

  ### Applications Category

  applications:

    heading: Applications

    questions:

      question1:
        summary: What makes a good application?
        details: >
          <p>The best applications will start with a very specific goal or problem that relates to using procurement to power an effective or inclusive recovery. You might want to improve the quality of school meals or school infrastructure, expand access to reliable public transportation, make public purchases more environmentally-friendly, or aim to give more contracting opportunities to women- or minority-owned businesses. In your application, be as specific as possible about how better contracting processes will help you achieve these goals.</p>

          <p>Note that Lift is not for general capacity building on open contracting or advocacy. While training, workshops, and OCDS publication and tools and advocacy are important, they cannot be the whole of your Lift project—they should just be a means to serve your goal.</p>

          <p>Also, we encourage you to be clear about how you will measure and track progress against your goals. For example, potential metrics might be the number of women-owned businesses who win contracts, feedback from residents about the quality of food or the cleanliness of public parks, infrastructure projects completed on time and within budget, etc.</p>

      question2:
        summary: What are the key questions that I should think about before submitting an application?
        details: >
          <p>We require that you answer all questions and submit a complete application. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-c63jnsrmUjgxM4LBD3ERqKSEw1LEcNXxnDJnqGK6kY/edit?usp=sharing">View the application questions here. </a>To make the best application possible, focus especially on developing concrete answers to these four questions:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>What is the problem that you are seeking to address through Lift?&nbsp;</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Tip: Focus on a specific goal or problem relating to the quality of public goods, works, or services, or access to opportunity. Explain how this problem relates to an inclusive and effective recovery from the pandemic.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>What is the solution to this problem?</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Tip: Think beyond implementing the OCDS, rolling out a new platform or tool, or running workshops. Instead, explain what the future that you want to see is and the concrete outcomes you anticipate by the Lift program&rsquo;s end in June of 2022.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>What are your &lsquo;powers&rsquo; to make change happen, and who in power will help you make this change happen?&nbsp;</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Tip: Lift is for teams that can achieve measurable improvements in public goods, works, and services or expand economic opportunity as part of supporting an inclusive and effective recovery. This requires that Lift teams have the power to make change. You might have to change regulations or policies, upgrade data or IT infrastructure or rethink processes - doing so often requires political buy-in and robust mandates for change. Consider what organizational strategies or key relationships that give you the power to pursue your work.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Who is on your core team, and why are they involved?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tip: Lift is for teams that have skills and represent the agencies or organizations that are integral for project success. For example, if your project is about improving the quality of public housing through procurement reform, it would be smart to have someone on the team who is from the public housing agency.</p>

  ### Project Category

  project:

    heading: Project

    questions:

      question6:
        summary: At what stage or scale should my project be to apply? Does it have to be an idea, prototype, or MVP? Should it be focused locally or globally?
        details: >
          <p>Lift is open to projects at different stages of development and scale. You could be embarking on a new initiative, or working to refine and scale a piloted solution. We require that your project has leadership support, which might include a budget for your work, a political champion, or a formal mandate. You could also be solving problems in your region, country, or city. Your project does not need to be able to scale globally.</p>

      question8:
        summary: Are there any sectors or topics Lift is particularly interested in?
        details: >
          <p>No, we are open to a wide range of sectors. You qualify for Lift as long as you are working for a more inclusive and effective recovery through increased openness in procurement, regardless of sector. For example, your focus could be on education, health, infrastructure, transportation, or expanding economic opportunity.</p>

      question9:
        summary: Can my project be for implementing the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) or OC4IDS?
        details: >
          <p>We are looking for projects that go beyond implementing OCDS or OC4IDS. Your project should be focused on improving a public good, work, or service and using the OCDS as a tool to achieve that goal. However, implementing OCDS or OC4IDS may be one part of your project.</p>
          <p>If your focus is solely on implementing OCDS or OC4IDS, Lift is not for you. But please reach out to our helpdesk at data@open-contracting.org who is happy to support anyone interested in implementing OCDS.</p>

      question10:
        summary: Is adopting and/or implementing the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) or OC4IDS required to be eligible for the program?
        details: >
          <p>No, but we do expect that your reform initiative involves making information or data more accessible. Lift can provide support in implementing <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/">OCDS</a> or OC4IDS if it is part of your project.</p>
          <p>Want to learn more about OCDS or OC4IDS? Visit the <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/">OCP website</a> for information and resources.</p>

      question11:
        summary: How can I be sure my team is the right fit for this program?
        details: >
          <p>This impact-oriented program is best suited for teams who are:&nbsp;</p>

          </ol>
          <p>Open Contracting Lift is not for teams who only want support on tool development or <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/">Open Contracting Data Standard</a> implementation.</p>

      question12:
        summary: How big should my team be? What key roles and skills should my team have to be successful in the program?

          <p>We suggest you keep your teams to 3 to 10 people for easy management.</p>

      question13:
        summary: Should my team be from one organization or a collaboration of multiple organizations?
        details: >
          <p>While we welcome teams from one organization, we are particularly interested in teams that represent collaborative partnerships. In the past we have seen that teams that bring together many diverse actors from different stakeholder groups and government agencies are more effective in achieving change.</p>

      question14:
        summary: How many teams will you select?
        details: >
          <p>We will select up to 7 teams for the program.</p>

    questions:

      question15:
        summary: How do you determine country eligibility? Are there any particular countries Lift is interested in?
        details: >
          <p>Lift uses Reporters Sans Frontiers&rsquo; <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking_table?sort=desc&amp;order=Ranking">World Press Freedom Index 2020</a>. Lift is open to countries deemed &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Satisfactory,&rdquo; &ldquo;Problematic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Difficult&rdquo; by this index. Lift will not work in countries that are deemed to be in a &ldquo;very serious situation&rdquo; (color: black) according to the index.</p>
          <p>Lift will consider working in countries that are deemed to be in a &ldquo;difficult situation&rdquo; (color: red) according to the index when applicants can demonstrate during the application process that there is collaboration amongst selected government and civil society actors and a partially safe space that civil society can work in.</p>
          <p>We are not looking for any particular countries, but for a geographic spread so that the Lift cohort includes a diverse mix of contexts.&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Effectively build leadership support to drive a robust mandate for your project.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Improve use of open data and open data systems to manage, monitor, and advance the quality of delivery of public goods, works, and services or expand access to opportunity.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Establish new ways of working with public contracts to ensure contracting processes and contracts lead to intended results.</li>
